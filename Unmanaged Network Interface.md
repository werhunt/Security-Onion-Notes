Received error "ethernet-device-not-managed" while assigning Network Monitoring Interfaces during initial setup.  

To get past this problem, make the below adjustment:

sudo nano /usr/lib/NetworkManager/conf.d/10-globally-managed-devices.conf

change the value for ```unmanaged-devices=*``` to ```unmanaged-devices=none```

save and restart Network Manager with ```sudo systemctl restart NetworkManager```
